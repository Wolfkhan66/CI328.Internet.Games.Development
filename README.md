# InExile
InExile is a simple 2D brawler platformer with 3 game modes. 
The main objective of the game is to get a high score, and each mode gives the player a different approach to achieve that.  

# Gameplay
In each game mode the gameplay is simple. The player can move left, right, jump and perform a 3combo attack to kill enemies. Enemies will approach the player from either side of the map and perform either a jumping attack, ranged attack or a melee attack to kill the player. If the player dies, then game is over, and they must try again to get a higher score. 

When picking a game mode, the player can select from 3 varying levels of difficulty: easy, normal and hard. The higher the difficulty, the more punishing the enemies and the more points they are worth. The player also has the choice if fighting enemies on 2 different maps with different platform layouts. 

# Classic
In ‘Classic’ mode the player fights through waves to get a high score. Each wave is slightly more difficult than the last and for each enemy killed the player gains some points. The game only ends when the player dies. 

# TimeAttack
In ‘TimeAttack’ mode the game starts with a countdown timer. Instead of waves, enemies flow constantly and the player must kill as many as they can before time runs out. For each enemy killed the player gains a small time bonus and some points. If time runs out or the player dies, then the game is over. 

# Survival
In ‘Survival’ mode there are no waves of timers. Instead, players face an endless onslaught of enemies and to get a high score they need to kill as many as possible before they die.
